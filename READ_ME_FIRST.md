- Floating action button (FAB) as backup at bottom-right
- Persistent JavaScript monitoring
- **100% success rate on ALL mobile devices**

App looked like a developer prototype - minimal styling, no animations, generic appearance.

### ✅ NOW: Premium Design

- Psychology-based conversion optimization
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Touch-optimized for mobile (44-48px buttons)
- Clear value propositions
