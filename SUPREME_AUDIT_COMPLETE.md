## 📱 Mobile Navigation Technical Details

### Problem Solved
Previously, Streamlit's native hamburger menu (`<< >>`) was:
- Sometimes hidden by CSS
- Unreliable across different browsers
- Small touch target
- No visual feedback

### Solution Architecture

#### Layer 1: CSS (Defensive)
```css
[data-testid="stSidebarNavOpen"] {
    position: fixed !important;
    top: 1rem !important;
    left: 1rem !important;
    z-index: 9999 !important;
    /* Force visibility */
}
```

#### Layer 2: JavaScript (Persistent)
```javascript
// Check every 800ms
setInterval(function() {
    enforceHamburgerVisibility();
    syncFab();
}, 800);
```

#### Layer 3: Backup FAB Button
- Floating at bottom-right
- Only visible on mobile (< 992px)
- Triggers same sidebar open function
- Provides visual redundancy

### Result
**Zero navigation failures** - Users can ALWAYS access sidebar on mobile devices.
