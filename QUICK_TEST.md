# 🎯 QUICK TEST - Recording Button (30 Seconds)

## ✅ Your App is Running!

The warnings you see are **NORMAL and SAFE**:
- ⚠️ `ffmpeg not found` → HTML5 fallback recorder will be used (works great!)
- ⚠️ `bcrypt error` → Auto-switched to pbkdf2 (secure alternative, works fine!)

### Step 8: Verify Clone Button Enabled

## 🔍 Debug Panel (Sidebar)

Look in the sidebar for **"🔍 Debug: Recording State"**

Expand it to see:
```json
{
  "fallback_wav_b64_size": 234567,  ← Should be > 0 after recording
  "recording_locked_in": true,       ← Should be true after "Use Recording"
  "DEBUG_LOGGING_env": "1"           ← Confirms debug mode on
}
```

## ❌ If "Use Recording" Still Doesn't Work

### Check #1: Sidebar Debug Panel
- Open "🔍 Debug: Recording State"
- After clicking "Use Recording", check if `recording_locked_in` becomes `true`
- If YES → recording was received, check if page refreshed
- If NO → recording didn't reach backend

### Check #2: Browser Console
- Press F12 to open DevTools
- Go to Console tab
- Look for `"Delivered ✔"` message
- Look for any red errors

### Check #3: Streamlit Terminal
- Check the terminal where you ran `streamlit run app.py`
- Look for messages like: `"Bridge: Locked in XXkB"` or `"Component: Locked in XXkB"`
- These appear ONLY if DEBUG_LOGGING=1

### Check #4: Recording Size
- After clicking "Use Recording"
- Check sidebar debug panel
- `fallback_wav_b64_size` should be > 50000 (50KB+)
- If 0 → recording didn't transfer
