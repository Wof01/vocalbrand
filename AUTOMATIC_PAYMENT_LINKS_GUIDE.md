# AUTOMATIC PAYMENT LINKS - Complete Guide

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE SOLVED

### The Problem (Before)
- Monthly subscription (€29) = AUTOMATIC ✅
- Payment Links (Setup, Packs) = MANUAL ❌
- Customer pays → Gets nothing → You manually activate → BAD UX!

### The Solution (Now)
**EVERYTHING IS AUTOMATIC** ✅

- Payment Link purchase → Webhook detects it → Instant account credit
- Customer sees balance immediately in sidebar
- Zero manual work required

---

## How It Works (Technical)

### 1. Customer Journey

```
Customer clicks Payment Link (e.g., €89 Pack)
    ↓
Stripe Checkout opens
    ↓
Customer enters email: customer@example.com
    ↓
Payment completes
    ↓
Stripe sends webhook → your server
    ↓
Webhook detects:
  - Product: "Voice Minutes Pack 60"
  - Amount: €89
  - Email: customer@example.com
    ↓
Looks up user by email
    ↓
Adds 60 minutes to user's balance
    ↓
Customer refreshes app → sees "⚡ Minutes: 60 min"
    ↓
DONE! ✅ Fully automatic
```

### 2. What Gets Added Automatically

| Purchase | Database Column | What Customer Sees |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Pack 60 (€89) | `minutes_balance +60` | "⚡ Minutes: 60 min" |
| Pack 300 (€399) | `minutes_balance +300` | "⚡ Minutes: 300 min" |
| Pack 1000 (€1,299) | `minutes_balance +1000` | "⚡ Minutes: 1000 min" |
| Setup Pro (€497) | `setup_credits +1` | "🚀 Setup credits: 1" |
| Setup Enterprise (€997) | `setup_credits +1` | "🚀 Setup credits: 1" |
| Annual Pro (€290) | `subscription_active =1` | "Subscription: Active 💎" |

## Database Schema Changes

### New Columns Added

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN minutes_balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN setup_credits INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

**Migration is automatic** - runs on first `init_db()`

### New Functions in `auth.py`

```python
add_minutes_balance(user_id, minutes)     # Add minutes to balance
get_minutes_balance(user_id)              # Check current balance
add_setup_credits(user_id, credits)       # Add setup credits
get_setup_credits(user_id)                # Check setup credits
get_user_by_email(email)                  # Find user by email
```

---

## Webhook Intelligence

### Product Detection (Automatic)

The webhook is SMART - it detects products by:

1. **Product Name** (e.g., "Voice Minutes Pack 60")
2. **Amount** (e.g., €89.00 = 60 min pack)

```python
# Examples of automatic detection:
€89 → 60 minutes
€399 → 300 minutes
€1,299 → 1000 minutes
€497 → 1 setup credit (Professional)
€997 → 1 setup credit (Enterprise)
€290 → Activates subscription (Annual)
```

### Supported Events

- `checkout.session.completed` - New purchase (subscription OR one-time)
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription cancelled
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Subscription renewed/changed

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Enhanced Webhook

Your webhook server (`webhook_server.py`) now handles everything automatically.

**Run it:**
```powershell
uvicorn webhook_server:app --reload --port 8787
```

**For production (Streamlit Cloud):**
Deploy webhook separately or use a service like Railway/Render.

### Step 2: Configure Stripe Webhook

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. URL: `https://your-webhook-domain.com/stripe`
4. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed` ← **CRITICAL**
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
5. Copy webhook signing secret
6. Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...` in environment

### Step 3: Test with Stripe CLI (Local)

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Run webhook server
uvicorn webhook_server:app --reload --port 8787

# Terminal 2: Forward Stripe events
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8787/stripe

# Terminal 3: Trigger test event
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

### Step 4: Create Payment Links with Email Collection

**CRITICAL:** When creating Payment Links in Stripe, ensure:

✅ **"Collect customer email" is ENABLED**
✅ This allows webhook to match customer to VocalBrand account

**In Stripe Dashboard:**
1. Create Payment Link
2. Under "Collect customer information"
3. Check ✅ "Email addresses"
4. Save

## Customer Instructions

### For Automatic Credit Activation

**Tell your customers:**

> **Important:** When checking out via Payment Links, use the SAME email address as your VocalBrand account. Credits will be added automatically within seconds.
>
> - ✅ VocalBrand account: `customer@example.com`
> - ✅ Stripe checkout: `customer@example.com`
> - ❌ Different email = manual processing required

### What Customers See

**Before Purchase:**
```
Account
Signed in as customer@example.com

```

**After Purchasing 60 Min Pack (€89):**
```
Account

## Testing the Automation

### Test 1: Minutes Pack Purchase

1. **Create test account** in your app: `test@example.com`
2. **Open Payment Link** for Pack 60 in Stripe test mode
3. **Checkout with email**: `test@example.com`
4. **Use test card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. **Complete purchase**
6. **Check webhook logs**: Should see `[INFO] Added 60 minutes to user X`
7. **Refresh app**: Should see "⚡ Minutes: 60 min" in sidebar

**Expected:**
- ✅ Webhook receives event
- ✅ Detects "Voice Minutes Pack 60" or amount €89
- ✅ Finds user by email
- ✅ Adds 60 to `minutes_balance`
- ✅ Customer sees balance immediately

### Test 2: Setup Service Purchase

1. **Same account**: `test@example.com`
2. **Open Payment Link** for Setup Professional
3. **Complete purchase** (€497)
4. **Check webhook logs**: `[INFO] Added 1 setup credits to user X`
5. **Refresh app**: See "🚀 Setup credits: 1"

### Test 3: Multiple Purchases

1. Buy Pack 60 → Balance: 60 min
2. Buy Pack 300 → Balance: 360 min (cumulative!)
3. Buy Pack 1000 → Balance: 1360 min

**Balances are cumulative** - they add up!

## Webhook Logs & Monitoring

### Success Messages (What You Want to See)

```
[INFO] Added 60 minutes to user 5, new balance: 60
[INFO] Added 300 minutes to user 5, new balance: 360
[INFO] Added 1 setup credits to user 5, new total: 1
[INFO] Activated subscription for user 5
```

### Warning Messages (Needs Attention)

```
[WARN] Could not identify user for checkout session cs_test_xxx
```
**Cause:** Customer used different email than VocalBrand account
**Solution:** Manually credit account or ask customer to use correct email

```
[WARN] Unknown product type for "Custom Product", amount 5000
```
**Cause:** New product not in detection patterns
**Solution:** Update `detect_product_type()` function in webhook_server.py

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### Case 1: Customer Uses Different Email

**Problem:**
- VocalBrand account: `john@company.com`
- Stripe checkout: `john.personal@gmail.com`
- Webhook can't find user → No automatic credit

**Solutions:**

**Option A: Manual Credit (Quick)**
```python
from auth import add_minutes_balance, get_user_by_email

# Find user
user = get_user_by_email("john@company.com")

# Add minutes manually
if user:
    add_minutes_balance(user["id"], 60)
    print(f"Added 60 minutes to user {user['id']}")
```

**Option B: Support Flow (Scalable)**
1. Customer emails support: "I paid but didn't get credits"
2. You check Stripe payment: Find email `john.personal@gmail.com`
3. You check VocalBrand: Find account `john@company.com`
4. Run manual credit script above
5. Done in 2 minutes

### Case 2: Refund Request

**When customer requests refund:**

```python
# 1. Process refund in Stripe
# 2. Remove credits from account:
from auth import add_minutes_balance

user_id = 5
add_minutes_balance(user_id, -60)  # Negative to deduct
```

### Case 3: Testing New Products

**Before adding new packs:**

1. Create product in Stripe
2. Add to `detect_product_type()` patterns:

```python
MINUTES_PACK_PATTERNS = {
    "60": 60,
    "300": 300,
    "1000": 1000,
    "2000": 2000,  # ← Add new pack
}
```

3. Test in Stripe test mode
4. Verify webhook detects correctly
5. Deploy to production

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live

- [ ] Database migrated (auto-migrates on `init_db()`)
- [ ] Webhook server running on production URL
- [ ] Stripe webhook endpoint configured with production URL
- [ ] `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set in production environment
- [ ] Payment Links created with "Collect email" ENABLED
- [ ] Test purchases completed successfully in test mode
- [ ] Webhook logs showing correct detection
- [ ] Switch to live Stripe keys

### Environment Variables (Production)

```bash
# Core
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_xxx

# Payment Links (optional - if using)
ANNUAL_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/live/...
SETUP_PRO_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/live/...
SETUP_ENT_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/live/...
PACK60_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/live/...

PACK1000_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/live/...

# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///vocalbrand.db
```

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. Deduct Minutes on Usage

Currently balances are added but not deducted. To implement:

```python
# In render_generation_section(), after successful generation:
if user_id and minutes_bal > 0:
    # Deduct 1 minute per generation
    add_minutes_balance(user_id, -1)
```

### 2. Purchase History

Track all purchases in a separate table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE purchases (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    product_type TEXT,
    amount INTEGER,
    stripe_payment_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 3. Email Notifications

Send confirmation emails when credits are added:

```python
# After add_minutes_balance():
send_email(
    to=user["email"],
    subject="Credits Added to Your VocalBrand Account",
    body=f"60 minutes have been added. Balance: {new_balance} min"
)
```

### 4. Admin Dashboard

Show all purchases and balances:

```python
# In page_admin():
conn = _get_conn()
cur = conn.execute(
    "SELECT email, minutes_balance, setup_credits FROM users WHERE minutes_balance > 0 OR setup_credits > 0"
)
st.table(cur.fetchall())
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Credits not showing after purchase"

**Check:**
1. ✅ Webhook endpoint receiving events? (Check Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Recent deliveries)
2. ✅ Webhook signature valid? (Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
3. ✅ Customer used correct email? (Check Stripe payment vs VocalBrand account)
4. ✅ Product detected correctly? (Check webhook logs)

**Debug:**
```powershell
# Check webhook server logs
# Look for [INFO] or [WARN] messages
```

### "Webhook returning 400 error"

**Cause:** Invalid signature or malformed payload

**Fix:**
1. Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe Dashboard
2. Check webhook server logs for detailed error
3. Test with Stripe CLI: `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed`

### "Unknown product type warnings"

**Cause:** New product not in detection patterns

**Fix:**
1. Add product name or amount to `detect_product_type()`
2. Restart webhook server
3. Test again
