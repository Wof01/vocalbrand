**Solution:** Usage counter now stored in database, persists across sessions/refreshes

---

## ✅ TEST IN 30 SECONDS

```powershell
# 1. Run the app
streamlit run app.py

# 2. Log in as demo user
#    Email: demo@vocalbrand.local
#    Password: demo123

# 3. Generate 3 speeches
#    - Clone Voice → upload audio → clone
#    - Generate Speech → enter text → Generate (3x)
#    - Should see: "Free plan usage: 3/3 generations"

# 4. 🔥 THE TEST: Press F5 to refresh
#    - Should STILL show "3/3 generations" (not reset to 0/3)
#    - Button should still be disabled
```

**✅ If usage counter stays at 3/3 after refresh = BUG IS FIXED**

## 💰 PRICING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Start With (Easiest to Sell)
- ✅ Monthly Pro: €29/mo (already have)
- ✅ Annual Pro: €290/yr (17% discount)
- ✅ Setup Professional: €497 (onboarding service)

### Add Later (After Cost Verification)
- ⏳ Minutes Packs (verify your ElevenLabs CPM first)
- ⏳ Setup Enterprise (when targeting larger teams)

### Pricing Psychology
- Annual saves 2 months → "17% savings" message
- Setup services = high-margin, low-effort revenue
- Minutes Packs = usage-based upsell for power users

---

## 🛡️ COMPLIANCE

✅ **CONTEXT06 compliant:**
- Bug fix doesn't change core flows
- Payment UI is visual-only (no logic changes)
- Database migration is backward-compatible
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

✅ **Safe to deploy:**
- All existing users unaffected
- Database column added automatically
- Payment Links are optional (work without them)
- No dependency changes

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Usage counter still resets on refresh"
- Check database was migrated: `python -c "import auth; auth.init_db()"`
- Verify column exists: See CRITICAL_FIX_USAGE_TRACKING.md Test 1
- Check you're logged in (counter only works for authenticated users)

### "Payment Links don't show in UI"
- Verify environment variables are set (exact variable names)
- Restart Streamlit after adding env vars
- Check no typos in URLs (should start with https://)
- Payment Links are optional - app works fine without them

### "Database migration error"
- SQLite < 3.35.0 may not support ALTER TABLE well
- Solution: Delete vocalbrand.db and let init_db() recreate it
- Or manually add column: `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN free_generations_used INTEGER DEFAULT 0`

- ✅ Free users hitting 3/3 limit → convert to Pro
