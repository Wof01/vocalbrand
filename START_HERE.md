## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: "Use Recording" clicked but nothing happens

**Quick Fix:**
1. Open sidebar → Expand `🔍 Debug: Recording State`
2. Check if `recording_locked_in` is `true`
3. If `false` → Check if `LATEST_RECORDING_size` > 0
4. If `0` → Recording didn't reach backend

**Then:**
- Press F12 (browser console)
- Look for "Delivered ✔" or errors
- Check Streamlit terminal for debug messages

### Problem: Clone button stays disabled

**Check:**
1. Is green "Recording Locked In" badge showing?
2. Does debug panel show `recording_locked_in: true`?
3. Is `fallback_wav_b64_size` > 50000?

**If all YES but button disabled:**
- Scroll up/down to trigger render
- Click anywhere on page
- Try refreshing browser (F5)

## 🎯 Expected Performance
