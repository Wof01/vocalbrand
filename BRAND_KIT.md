## 🏆 Competitive Positioning

### Against ElevenLabs
"While ElevenLabs is powerful, VocalBrand offers faster cloning (30s vs 5min), simpler pricing (€29 vs complex credits), and better reliability (99.9% uptime guaranteed)."

### Against Descript
"Descript is great for video editing, but VocalBrand specializes in voice cloning with faster generation (<1.2s avg) and unlimited Pro usage vs Descript's limits."

### Against Murf.AI
"Murf offers pre-made voices. VocalBrand clones YOUR unique voice - your authentic tone, cadence, and personality. Own your voice, don't rent someone else's."
