## 🆘 Troubleshooting Email Display

### "Email looks like plain text"
**Cause:** Gmail HTML disabled or old email client
**Fix:** Gmail automatically uses HTML, but provides plain text fallback

### "Reply-To doesn't work"
**Cause:** Email client doesn't support Reply-To header
**Fix:** Manually copy customer's email address

### "Email went to Spam"
**Fix:**
1. Click "Not Spam" in Gmail
2. Add your `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` to contacts
3. Gmail learns and future emails go to Inbox
